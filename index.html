    The name Chennai was derived from the name of Chennappa Nayaka, a Nayak ruler who served as a general under Venkata Raya of the Vijayanagara Empire from whom the British East India Company acquired the town in 1639.[11][12] As such, the city's name is of Telugu language origin.[13] The first official use of the name was in August 1939 in a sale deed to Francis Day of the East India Company, before the Chennakesava Perumal Temple was built in 1646 while some scholars argue to the contrary.[11][14]
